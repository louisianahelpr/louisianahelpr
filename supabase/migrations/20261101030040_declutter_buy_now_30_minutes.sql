-- BUY-1 (owner 10-31 ~9:35 and ~9:45 PM, via the lead): Buy now holds an item 30 MINUTES while the buyer checks out;
-- an accepted offer gives 24 HOURS to pay; a free claim keeps its own 48 hours. Unpaid at the end, the item goes back on
-- sale and the offers that hold closed open again, and their buyers are told.
--
-- WHAT (each function restated from its NEWEST CREATE; only the lines marked BUY-1 change):
--   declutter_offers.voided_by_line: the cart line (hold) that voided an offer, so the sweep reopens exactly those.
--   declutter_offer_events.action gains 'reopen'.
--   declutter_hold_length(price, source): 48 h free / 30 min Buy now / 24 h accepted offer, the one place the rule lives.
--   declutter_reopen_voided_offers(line): opens the offers a released hold voided (respond_by restarts at 48 hours, the
--     offer window), logs 'reopen' and tells each offer's buyer. Only while the item is live again.
--   declutter_take_item (20261030064929): the hold length above; the line is made first so each voided offer records it;
--     the void notice says the offer opens again if the hold runs out; 30-minute / 24-hour notice copy.
--   declutter_deadline_sweep (20261030152217): the 24 h and 2 h reminders only for holds long enough for them; the
--     awaiting-payment grace is 10 min (was 1 h); a released Buy now, accepted-offer or no-way-to-hand-over line reopens
--     its voided offers; "in time" in place of "within 48 hours"; the run counts offers_reopened.
--   declutter_attach_checkout_session (20261014224914): the payment race (lead): starting checkout stretches the
--     order's lines to the Stripe page's end (capped at the line's own hold plus one page).
--   declutter_mark_order_paid (20261028210552): a payment that lands on a released hold is refunded IN FULL (was: the
--     sale was brought back when the items were still unsold); the missed-checkout strike still goes.
