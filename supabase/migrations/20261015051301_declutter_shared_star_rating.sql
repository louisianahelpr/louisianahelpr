-- Declutter: ONE star rating (docs/specs/declutter-auctions.md row 45).
--
-- WHAT: a member's public star rating (get_public_profile_stats: avg_rating,
-- review_count) counted only job reviews, so a seller's or buyer's Declutter
-- reviews never showed on their profile. Lead decision 2026-10-15: Declutter
-- keeps its OWN review table (declutter_reviews, 20261015042253; the job
-- reviews table keys on job_id NOT NULL and stays untouched) and the rating is
-- computed across both.
--
-- HOW: get_public_profile_stats restated from 20261007033530 VERBATIM (live
-- prosrc md5 cc7f934c019b312b8d4abe2998e2be07 = that file's body, measured
-- read-only 2026-10-15) plus a Declutter branch in visible_reviews. A
-- Declutter review counts once it is public (both sides reviewed, or 14 days
-- after handover: the blind rule of declutter_visible_reviews), never as a
-- poster review, and a test account's stays hidden under the seed switch.
-- Grants restated as live ({postgres, service_role, anon, authenticated}=X).
--
-- Proof: src/test/pglite/declutterSharedStarRating.pglite.mjs (applied 3x).
-- Replay-safe: CREATE OR REPLACE, unchanged signature; it runs after
-- 20261015042253, which creates declutter_reviews and declutter_orders.
