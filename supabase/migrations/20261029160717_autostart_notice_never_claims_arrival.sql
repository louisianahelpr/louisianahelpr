-- THE AUTO-START NOTICE NEVER CLAIMS THE HELPR ARRIVED (audit 2026-10-29 A2-B12).
--
-- What was broken: auto_start_due_jobs (cron every 15 min; live body read
-- 2026-10-29) sets jobs.status = 'in_progress' on every booked job whose start
-- has passed, whether or not the Helpr set out or arrived. This trigger then
-- told the poster "Work has started — Eli H. has started working on ..." for a
-- Helpr who never came (AA9 chunk 1a, aa9-ns-*).
--
-- The fix: the in_progress branch checks for a recorded arrival
-- (helper_arrived_at, or the poster's poster_confirmed_arrival_at). Without
-- one: "Start time passed — Eli H. hasn't checked in for ... Open the job to
-- message them or report a no-show." (the card now offers Report no-show on
-- its face). With one: the old words. Nothing else changes: the body is the
-- live definition verbatim (pg_get_functiondef md5 d22b9dc6..., equal to
-- 20261023151519's) apart from that branch.
--
-- Replay-safe: CREATE OR REPLACE of an existing trigger function; the trigger
-- (trg_notify_poster_status on jobs) is untouched. Grants restated as live
-- (postgres, service_role only).
