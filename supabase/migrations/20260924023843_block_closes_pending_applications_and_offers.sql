-- Q345 (2). A block closes what is still pending between the two people.
--
-- WHAT WAS LEFT OPEN (read live on prod fncmgoasalhdgfwzhsqa, 2026-09-24,
-- pg_get_functiondef, read-only):
--
--   block_user_and_settle cancels LIVE shared jobs (accepted / in_progress /
--   revision_requested) and nothing else. A pending application between the
--   pair stays 'pending' — the applicant sees "pending" until the job resolves
--   some other way, though the poster can no longer see it (Q341 policy) nor
--   hire it (20260924023314). A pending direct offer between the pair stays
--   'pending', so C4 keeps the job reserved for a person who can no longer
--   accept it (20260924023314) until direct_offer_expires_at.
--
-- THE SMALLEST HONEST BEHAVIOUR, applied at block time only:
--
--   * Pending applications between the pair (either seat) become 'rejected'
--     with closed_reason = 'party_blocked', and NO notification is sent. The
--     person who blocked asked for no further contact; a "was not selected"
--     notice would be contact, and in the helper-blocked-the-poster direction
--     it would be false. The applicant's card reads as closed/not selected,
--     which says nothing about who blocked whom.
--   * A pending direct offer between the pair becomes 'declined' (the job
--     reopens to everyone, exactly as a decline does), silently. The poster's
--     card says "declined" either way, so it reveals nothing about direction.
--
--   A banned caller still settles nothing (Q301 early return, unchanged): the
--   applications UPDATE would be refused by trg_ban_gate_applications_update
--   and roll the block itself back.
--
-- NOT A BACKFILL. This changes what a block does from now on. Rows left
-- pending by blocks made before this migration are not touched — in
-- particular 4ce7742d… (the one live cross-block pending application, on
-- 2026-09-24), whose applicant is the owner's real account.
--
-- Bodies verbatim from live (block_user_and_settle last redefined for Q301;
-- notify_on_application for Q274) plus the additions marked Q345. Every RAISE
-- code is preserved.
--
-- REPLAY-SAFETY: constraint drop/add is IF EXISTS + re-add of a superset;
-- functions are CREATE OR REPLACE with unchanged signatures.
