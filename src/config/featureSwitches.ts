/**
 * Hidden feature switches: the client's copy of the registry.
 *
 * A new feature ships to the real app behind a switch that is on only for the
 * owner (admin role) and the test accounts, then is flipped on for everyone in
 * Admin -> Settings (owner decision, 2026-10-11). The registry itself is
 * `public.feature_switches` (migration 20261012031120); the server decides with
 * `public.feature_enabled_for(key)` and an RPC behind a hidden feature refuses
 * with `public.require_feature(key)`. How to add one: "How to ship a hidden
 * feature" in .claude/AGENT-BRIEF.md.
 *
 * This list is EXACT both ways (src/test/featureSwitchRegistry.test.ts): every
 * key here is created by a migration and read by a `useFeature("<key>")` call
 * in src, and every such call names a key here. A key nobody reads is a
 * leftover; a key no migration creates reads as OFF forever.
