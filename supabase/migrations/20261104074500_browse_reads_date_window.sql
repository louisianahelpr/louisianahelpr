-- Q2408 "Any time this week", part 2: Browse carries the window and keeps a window job listed all week.
--
-- open_jobs_browse is the newest definition (20261031000945) with exactly two changes:
--   1. date_window_end is appended as the last column (CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW may only add at the end), so the
--      cards can print "Any day Nov 4-10" instead of the first day;
--   2. the "its day has not passed" filter reads COALESCE(date_window_end, date_needed): without it a window job
--      would drop off Browse after its FIRST day while it is still open for the rest of the week. A one-day job
--      (NULL end) is filtered exactly as before.
-- Grants restated as the newest migration states them. jobs.date_window_end itself is granted to authenticated
-- in 20261104073000 (sync_jobs_select_grants).
