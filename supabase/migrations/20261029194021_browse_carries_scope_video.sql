-- A2-B6 (post-job video shown nowhere): the poster's optional scope video is
-- uploaded to the public job-photos bucket and its public URL stored in
-- jobs.scope_video_url (src/pages/post-job/useJobMediaUpload.ts), but the
-- browse view never carried the column, so the Helpr's browse sheet
-- (JobDetailDialog, which already draws a <video> when the field is set) and
-- the job page for a non-party always read it as undefined. The video was
-- stored and never seen by the people it was made for.
--
-- This appends jobs.scope_video_url (text) as the LAST column of
-- open_jobs_browse. The body is the newest definition,
-- 20261027185146_card_hold_at_post.sql section 9, verbatim; its column list
-- equals the live view's 45 columns (pg_attribute on prod, measured
-- 2026-10-29). Nothing else changes: same WHERE, same masking, the view stays
-- security_invoker = false (it MUST stay a definer view) and its grants are
-- restated as live (relacl 2026-10-29: anon, authenticated = SELECT).
--
-- What it exposes: the same rows already expose `photos`, public URLs in the
-- same public bucket. The video is the poster's own picture of the work, shown
-- for the same reason the photos are. No address, no coordinates.
--
-- REPLAY-SAFE: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW (append-only column), grants absolute.
-- Proof: src/test/pglite/browseCarriesScopeVideo.pglite.mjs.
