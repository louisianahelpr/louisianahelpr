-- Q1207: an offer the hourly sweep expires keeps saying it expired.
--
-- expire_unanswered_offers closes the Helpr's accepted application as
-- 'rejected' and reopens the job (helper_id and response_deadline cleared).
-- After that nothing on the rows the Helpr can read says the offer lapsed, so
-- deriveHelperWait (src/components/job-card/jobStatusLine.ts) turned "The
-- offer expired" into "You weren't picked" within the hour. The sweep now
-- stamps closed_reason = 'offer_expired', the way a job cancel stamps
-- 'job_cancelled' (Q274) and a block stamps 'party_blocked' (Q345), and the
-- status line reads it.
--
-- notify_on_application is unaffected: its rejected branch fires only on
-- pending -> rejected, and this close is accepted -> rejected.
--
-- No backfill: on prod 2026-10-04 (read-only SQL) 0 rejected applications
-- with a null closed_reason match a 'You lost a job offer' notice.
--
-- The function body is 20261004001807's verbatim (live, has the
-- job_accept_pending check) except the one applications UPDATE.
-- Replay-safe: DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS + ADD, CREATE OR REPLACE.
