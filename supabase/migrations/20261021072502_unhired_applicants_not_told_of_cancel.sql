-- Owner decision 2026-10-21: when a poster cancels a job, applicants who were NOT hired (or offered) get no
-- cancellation notification. Q274 (20260923205811) closes a cancelled job's pending applications with
-- closed_reason 'job_cancelled', and notify_on_application then sent each of them a bell item and an email
-- ('"<title>" was cancelled, so your application is closed'). Now it sends nothing to an applicant who is not
-- the job's offered Helpr (jobs.helper_id); the app shows their application as "This job is no longer
-- available" and the job leaves Browse. The hired Helpr's application is 'accepted' (never closed here) and
-- poster_cancel_job, create-payment's cancel and the crew paths keep their own notices to the hired/offered
-- Helpr, unchanged.
--
-- notify_on_application restated verbatim from its effective definition (20261003214350; prosrc md5 matched
-- prod 2026-10-21) but for the one new early return and the job's helper_id read beside its title.
-- REPLAY-SAFETY: CREATE OR REPLACE keeps the trigger and grants.
