-- block_user_and_settle prices a cancellation on COMMITMENT, like every other
-- cancel path, not on mere assignment.
--
-- WHAT WAS BROKEN. Migration 20260908155425 (owner decision 2026-09-08) moved
-- poster_cancel_job's fee, late flag and reliability strike from
-- `helper_id IS NOT NULL` to "committed" — `helper_id IS NOT NULL AND
-- helper_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL` — and `_shared/cancellationFee.ts`
-- (computeCancellationFee / helperIsCommitted, used by void-cancelled-payments
-- to move the money and by money-reconciliation to grade it) did the same.
-- block_user_and_settle was not moved. Its live definition (pg_get_functiondef,
-- prod, 2026-09-23) still read:
--     cancellation_fee_percent(v_job.helper_id IS NOT NULL, v_hours)
--     is_late_cancellation(v_job.helper_id IS NOT NULL, v_hours)
--     IF ... AND v_job.helper_id IS NOT NULL THEN apply_cancellation_violation_consequence
-- so blocking a Helpr the poster had CHOSEN but who never ACCEPTED, inside 24h
-- of the start, stored cancellation_fee = 25%/50% of budget, late_cancellation
-- = true, cancellation_fee_status = 'pending', told the Helpr a fee applied,
-- and wrote a cancel_with_helper strike against the poster.
--
-- BLAST RADIUS. The money itself was right: void-cancelled-payments recomputes
-- the fee from cancellationFee.ts and refunds the poster in full. What was
-- wrong is the stored row (fee pill, admin late-cancel revenue, reliability
-- record), the Helpr's notification, and the poster's strike.
-- money-reconciliation's cancellation_fee_mismatch (critical) would flag the
-- stored fee. Measured on prod 2026-09-23: 0 rows produced this way
-- (cancellation_reason = 'Cancelled because one party blocked the other.' has
-- never been written), but 6 seed jobs sat in accepted/in_progress with a
-- helper_id and no helper_confirmed_at — the shape was reachable.
--
-- THE FIX. One v_committed, the same predicate poster_cancel_job uses, feeds
-- the fee, the late flag and the strike. It can only move a charge from >0 to
-- 0, never the other way.
--
-- REPLAY-SAFE: CREATE OR REPLACE on an unchanged signature; the ladder call is
-- still guarded by to_regprocedure at run time; grants restated by role name.
