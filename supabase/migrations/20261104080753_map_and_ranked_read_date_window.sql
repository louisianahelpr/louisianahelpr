-- Q2408 "Any time this week", part 3: the map and the first-job Home list keep a window job until its last day.
--
-- get_open_jobs_for_map (the map pins, useMapJobs) and get_ranked_open_jobs (Jobs near you on the first-job Home,
-- FirstJobHome) filtered on job_offer_cutoff(date_needed, start_time) > now(). date_needed is a window job's FIRST
-- day, so a job posted "any day Nov 4-10" vanished from the map and from Home on Nov 5 while it was still open
-- on Browse (20261104074500) and still bookable. Each function is its newest definition (20261027185146) with
-- exactly two changes:
--   1. that filter reads COALESCE(date_window_end, date_needed): a one-day job (NULL end) is filtered exactly as before;
--   2. date_window_end is appended as the last returned column so the card prints the window, not the first day.
-- A new return column needs DROP FUNCTION + CREATE (CREATE OR REPLACE cannot change RETURNS TABLE), so the grants
-- and get_ranked_open_jobs' COMMENT are restated exactly as their newest statement (20261025235701). Neither function
-- takes an id from the caller; both stay SECURITY DEFINER with search_path pinned. Accept-path cutoffs are NOT
-- touched: booking the first day keeps the first day's cutoff. get_public_open_jobs is not called by the app (only a
-- comment in instant-job-match names it), so it is left alone.
-- REPLAY-SAFETY: jobs.date_window_end is added by 20261104073000, which runs first; DROP ... IF EXISTS + CREATE.
